/*Q2. Build a new Circle class with the following basic features:



Attributes:
o Center point - Build instance variables for the circle’s center point (use Point2D class
objetc).
o Diameter - Build an instance variable for the circle’s diameter (myDiameter also
represented as a double value).
Behaviors
o Default constructor - Build a default constructor that initializes the circle’s center
point to (0, 0) and its diameter to 100.
o Accessor methods - Build accessor methods for the two center coordinates and the
diameter.
Invariant
o The circle’s diameter should always be non-negative. maintain the integrity of each
circle object by ensuring that the class invariant (that the diameter should be non-
negative) is true at all times.
o
If the diameter is negative then throw user defined exception.
